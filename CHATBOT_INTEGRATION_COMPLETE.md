## 💬 Example Conversations

### Example 1: Basic Question
**User:** "What are exoplanets?"

**AI:** "Exoplanets are planets that orbit stars outside our solar system. Since the first confirmed detection in 1992, we've discovered over 5,000 exoplanets! They come in various types including gas giants like Jupiter, rocky planets like Earth, and unique types we don't have in our solar system like hot Jupiters and super-Earths."

### Example 2: Technical Question
**User:** "How does the transit method work?"

**AI:** "The transit method detects exoplanets by measuring the tiny dip in a star's brightness when a planet passes in front of it. Here's how it works:

1. **Continuous Monitoring**: Telescopes observe stars for extended periods
2. **Brightness Dip**: When a planet transits, the star's light dims slightly
3. **Pattern Detection**: Regular dips indicate an orbiting planet
4. **Data Analysis**: The depth and duration reveal the planet's size and orbit

This method has discovered most known exoplanets, including those found by the Kepler and TESS missions!"

### Example 3: Platform Help
**User:** "How do I use the dashboard?"

**AI:** "The ExoPlanet AI Dashboard is easy to use! Here's a quick guide:

1. **Input Data**: Enter orbital parameters like period, radius, and temperature
2. **Run Analysis**: Click the 'Analyze' button
3. **View Results**: See AI predictions with confidence scores
4. **Explore Details**: Check probability charts and metrics

You can also upload CSV files or use sample data to test the system. The AI will classify planets as Confirmed, Candidate, or False Positive based on the data!"
